      <h2>Canada History</h2>
      <div style="display: flex">
        <p>
          Canada has been inhabited by Aboriginal people since 1400 years ago.
          In the late 15th century, English and French colonists began to
          explore the east coast of North America and establish colonies there.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1763, at the end of the Seven Years' War, France ceded almost all
          of its North American colonies to Britain. In the following decades,
          the British explored westward into the Pacific and established several
          new colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          On July 1, 1867, the Constitution Act of 1867 was passed, and the
          Province of Canada was split into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec,
          joining the three British North American colonies of New Brunswick and
          Nova Scotia to form the Confederation of Canada. Over the next 100
          years, several other British North American colonies joined the Union
          to form modern Canada
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 11, 1931, the United Kingdom passed the Act of
          Westminster, which made Canada an independent country, the head of
          state was still King George V, and the British Parliament still had
          the power to amend the Constitution of Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1933 and 1949, the power of final adjudication in Canadian civil
          and criminal cases was transferred from the Judicial Committee of the
          Privy Council to the Supreme Court of Canada. On March 29, 1982, Queen
          Elizabeth II of Canada gave Royal Assent to the Parliament of Canada,
          transferring the power to amend the Constitution of Canada, thus
          ending the special legislative relationship between Canada and the
          United Kingdom.
